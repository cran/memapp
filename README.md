# The Moving Epidemics Method Shiny Web Application

## Overview

*memapp* is a web application created to serve as a graphical user interface for the R mem library. It was created using Shiny, a web application framework for R. This application uses the development version of the mem R library.

## Installation

The package can be installed from the official R repositories (*CRAN*) using the built-in install function:

```
# install the memapp CRAN version
install.packages("memapp")
```

Nevertheless, *memapp* uses some sensible packages that are updated frequently in their respective development versions hosted at github. To install the development version of *memapp* along with development versions of their dependencies, it is recommended to install it from the sources at github.

```
# install the devtools package
install.packages("devtools")
# install the memapp development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("lozalojo/memapp")
```

## Usage

To run the memapp application, just use the function:

```
# run the app:
memapp::runmemapp()
```

You can specify other parameters passed to `shiny::runApp`, such as `display = normal`, or  
`launch.browser = TRUE`.
